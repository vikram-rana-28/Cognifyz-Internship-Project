##  Description
This C++ program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

##  Features
- Random number generated between 1 and 100
- User keeps guessing until they find the correct number
- Helpful hints: “Too high” or “Too low”
- Uses `do-while` loop and `rand()` for logic

##  Concepts Used
- Loops (`do-while`)
- Conditional statements
- Random number generation (`srand`, `rand`)
- Basic input/output
